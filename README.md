Hello Ryan!

Here is my recording of my progress through the Alchemy Learning Readiness Exercise:

5/23
I saw that the exercise was in GitHub. I played with the views that were available for the readme file: raw, blame, history, normal. 
I wanted to learn how to put my notes into GitHub - I wanted to practice. 
I donâ€™t know how to create my own repository on GitHub. I need to research. 
I went through the tutorial on the GitHub front page. It turns out GitHub on my phone does not have a good way to create repositories, but on my iPad it is very easy! Now I have a readme file.
