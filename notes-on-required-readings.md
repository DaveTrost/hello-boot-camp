# Notes on required readings from the textbooks

## HTML elements

iFrames are interesting, I want to build one to test it out.

## HTML5 Layout

hgroup is like the PowerPoint default layout where each content slide has 2 title text boxes
In fact, the \<main\> tag is equivalent to the \<content\> tag that the author highlights on page 440 as being an element that is "missing" (when compared in parallel with \<aside\> \<header\> and \<footer\>).

### Next Steps

Need to revisit the end of Chapter 17 (web site example code) after completing the CSS tutorials

## Process

### Targeting site users

Surprisingly, there is no mention of desktop vs. device?

### Website planning tools

wireframes and content maps are analogous to research paper prep (outlines and paragraph structure)
